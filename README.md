# Preplate Description:
This application is designed to allow an authenticated user to look up a list of pre-populated food recipes and create a list based on personal preference and allergies to ingredients. The user's list will be in their profile where they can add or delete items from the list. Another list will be populated within the webpage that will be the ingredients needed to make the meal so that the user can make an appropriate grocery shopping list. 

# Current State of Project as of 3/7/2022:
Earliest stage of development. Files are being created and models are being designed.

# Future Improvements:
Currently implementing the User class and classes for meals.
